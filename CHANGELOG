## [0.1.0.1] - 2023-12-17

### Added
- Used SaaS Product to create "easy-oauth.saas-product.com" - a service that acts as a type of proxy between development projects and services, such as Gmail, that use OAuth to authenticate.  It works as 
follows: the angular client requests a URI from easy-oauth.saas-product.com, easy-oauth.saas-product.com has a callback pinged that has the token, and the original client polls for the availability of this 
token.  The solution is not intended to be used in production environments, but the purpose is to simplify initial setup of the project.

### Notes

Substantial progress has been made on the automated installation and deployment scripts.  The project is very close to having a "Wordpress" like, simple and easy installation.  It needs to be made more 
robust, as it still has maybe a 5% failure rate.
