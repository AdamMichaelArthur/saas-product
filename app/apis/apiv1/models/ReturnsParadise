ReturnsParadise

This brand is designed to solve a major problem that retailers, and especially e-commerce stores
face: returns

This product is simple.  The customer updates their return policy: customers must fill out the return
form on their phone or mobile device, where they are directed and prompted to take pictures of the 
item to be returned, they fill out the return reason, etc.

The product is designed for both e-commerce and traditional retailers.  Traditional retailers
can use the mobile app to quickly list the product.  When it sells, all they have to do is ship it out
from the store.

Or, the customer can complete the return through text

On the returns site, they click phone.

Then they get a text message

	->  We're really sorry about that.  The last step is to provide 3 pictures

Ok, you're all set!  You will receive an e-mail in 5-7 days with the shipping label.
