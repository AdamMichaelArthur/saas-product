Kristina has a site without any links.

She used Content Bounty to get all of the content made, and now it's time to start a Link Building Campaign

In her particular case, she wants Content Bounty to handle all of the initial Outreach, but she will respond
personally to any replies.

To get the process started, she will click on "Brand Management", then "Link Building"

The software shows a list of pages on her website that are candidates to do link building for.

She selects the pages she wants links to, and then clicks "Link Building"

She could automate the entire process if she wanted to, but in her case she is going to leave "Respond to Incoming Emails" off
because she prefers to respond to replies herself.  But, if she wanted to, she could automate the entire process.

That's literally it.  From this point on, Content Bounty takes over.  Kristina doesn't have to do anything else -- in 2-3 days
times, custom emails will start to get sent out on her behalf from experienced link builders.
