SaaS Product supports reasonably sophisticated account types.

Registration happens at the account level.  When a new user registers at the top level, they are in fact creating both a user account and a top-level account.
Every account must have at least one user, and every user must have an account, which may have many users.

Accounts can register, and invite, sub-account users.  All data created by these sub-users is accessible to the account, and the account owns the data.

It's also supports collaborators.  A collaborator is a user that has a separate account, but is granted certain permissions and can act as a sub-user on a different account
