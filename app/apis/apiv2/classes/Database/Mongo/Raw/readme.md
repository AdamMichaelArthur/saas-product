In most circumstances, you'll want to use the framework.  However, there are situations where
you know what you are doing, and you want direct access to the database without the interference
of the framework.  

This class grants the developer direct, raw access to the underlying data.  There are no guardrails
or protections here, and developer competency is assumed.  If you use these methods, its done intentionally
with care and thought.
