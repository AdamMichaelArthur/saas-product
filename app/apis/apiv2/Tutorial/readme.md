Tutorial
========

This tutorial is designed to get the reader up to speed very quickly with
creating this project.

The vast majority of new code will fall into doing something like this:

	Create a new endpoint to implement a new feature
	CRUD operations against the database
	Process / manipulate data
	Return a result

This project is designed to allow the developer to focus on new code quickly
without having to worry about the underlying guts of the project.
