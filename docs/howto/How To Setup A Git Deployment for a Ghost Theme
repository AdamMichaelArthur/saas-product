How To Setup A Git Deployment for a Ghost Theme

1.	Login to the target server

	ssh root@www.contentbounty.com

	If you do not have SSH access to the server, contact Adam

2.	In the root directory after login, type 'ls'

3.	See if a file there is called 'project-create.sh'

	IF YES -- then proceed to step 4

	IF NOT -- copy the file project-create.sh to the server.  If you don't know how to do this, see USING SCP

4.	Type 'sh project-create.sh www.contentbounty.com'

	Be sure to replace www.contentbounty.com with the name of the actual website

Your new git remote will be:

	ssh://www.contentbounty.com/srv/git/www.contentbounty.com

5.	Create a new directory on your local machine where you want to work

	mkdir contentbounty-theme
