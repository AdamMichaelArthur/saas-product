How To Make A Copy of the database to work locally

Important: working locally requires us to disable some features of content bounty
so if you work locally the benefit is it is MUCH faster, but there are some things
you won't be able to do or that may cause problems, including:

	Creating new bounties
	Opening Files, Folders and Templates

among other things

Step 1		In your .env file, add or edit the key "DISABLE_BOX" to DISABLE_BOX="true"
			Note that the "true" in quotation marks IS important, you cannot write DISABLE_BOX=true

			This disable the Box.js file and the Box integration -- which is the main reason we've been
			needing to connect to the database on the server, as opposed to working with a local copy

Step 2		If your local mongo IS NOT setup for replication, you need to get that done first.

Step 3		Once replica sets are setup on your local mongodb instance, you need to download the database
			we want to work from

			We have three databases for you to choose from:
			
			contentbounty
			contentbounty-prod
			contentbounty-copy

			mkdir cb_database
			cd db_database
			mongodump --host app.contentbounty.com --username adam --password dino --authenticationDatabase=admin --db contentbounty-prod
			mongorestore dump/ 
			OR
			mongorestore --drop

Step 4		Change your .env file to use localhost instead of the remote server
			DB_DOMAIN = "localhost"

Step 5		Understand the limitations of working from a local copy of the database
			1.	A lot of functionality will not work, or at least not 100% -- such as
				creating new bounties.
